# NetWatch
NetWatch is a Python module for network traffic analysis. It is designed for ethical hackers and security researchers who need to monitor network traffic for security breaches and other sensitive information. The module is built using object-oriented programming principles and provides an easy-to-use interface for analyzing network traffic.

# Installation

To install NetWatch, run the following command in your terminal:
```
pip install netwatch
```
# Usage

To use NetWatch, you first need to import the module:
```
import netwatch
```
Next, create a PacketAnalyzer object:

```
analyzer = netwatch.PacketAnalyzer()
```
You can then start capturing network traffic by calling the `capture` method:
```
analyzer.capture()
```
The `capture` method will capture network traffic and analyze it for sensitive information such as user credentials, URLs, and other data.

Once the capture is complete, you can retrieve the analysis results by calling the `get_results` method:
```
results = analyzer.get_results()
```
The `get_results` method returns a dictionary of the analysis results. The keys in the dictionary correspond to the type of information analyzed (e.g., "user_credentials", "urls", etc.), and the values are lists of the sensitive data found in the network traffic.

NetWatch also provides an easy-to-use command-line interface. To start the CLI, run the following command:
```
python -m netwatch.cli
```
This will start the NetWatch CLI, which provides a menu-based interface for capturing and analyzing network traffic.
